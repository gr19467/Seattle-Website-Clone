            <p class="grid-item-2">One of Seattle's most famous restaurants is Pike Place Chowder. They hold the title for most rated dish on Yelp in the country, and also
                hold many first place titles in food competitions. They are also 100% certified sustainable.

            <a class="grid-item-1" href="https://www.thepinkdoor.net/">-The Pink Door-</a>
            <p class="grid-item-2">The Pink Door isn't just a restaurant, but also a great experience. They have many forms of entertainment, 
                like music, tarot, cabaret, trapeze, and more. It's also an italian-american restaurant, which means you can take a break from the seafood.</p>

            <p class="grid-item-2">While it may not entirely qualify as food, the first Starbucks ever is located right here in Seattle. It's a must see
                for Starbucks fans, and is conveniently located in <a href="tosee.html">Pike Place Market</a>. Beware, because the line is usually out the door.
